          <h3>Bone Whistle Replica</h3>
          <p class="itemId">item001</p>
          <p>This item was from the Anthropological Collection. This handcrafted replica reproduces a 2,000-year-old whistle discovered in a hillside shrine in Northern Italy. The original artifact, carved from an animal femur and shaped with precision-drilled tonal holes, was used for ritual timing or sacred communication. Its smooth surface and polished rim suggest repeated use in ceremonies involving bronze bells and wooden drums. The replica preserves the authentic form and symbolic essence of the Etruscan-era instrument—believed to have served as a bridge between human and divine realms.

            <h3>Bronze Chariot Wheel Replica</h3>
            <p class="itemId">item002</p>
            <p>This was from the Archaeological Collection. This detailed replica mirrors an ancient bronze and cedar chariot wheel dating back over 2,300 years. The original, discovered beneath temple floor tiles in Tyre, Lebanon, featured hammered joints, cast-spoke hubs, and a smooth inner axle ring — hallmarks of expert craftsmanship. Its rim displayed abrasion and wear, suggesting ceremonial racing or royal processions rather than warfare. Symbolic of divine motion and regal authority, the wheel's design aligns closely with Assyrian ceremonial chariots unearthed at Nimrud.</p>

            <h3>Ceramic Oil Flask Replica</h3>
            <p class="itemId">item003</p>
            <p>This was from the Archaeological Collection. This carefully crafted replica reproduces an 1,800-year-old terracotta oil flask once used by ancient Greek athletes. The original, discovered in a bathhouse drain channel at Corinth, featured a sleek oval body and narrow neck ideal for controlled pouring. Organic residue found within suggests it once held olive oil used in pre-race cleansing and muscle preparation rituals. With its wheel-thrown construction and stamped spiral base, the flask reflects the artistry and symbolism of readiness before competition, paralleling Roman oil vessels unearthed in Pompeii.</p>

            <h3>Iron Wheel Bearing Replica</h3>
            <p class="itemId">item004</p>
            <p>This was from the Archaeological Collection. This replica reproduces a 2nd-century BCE iron wheel bearing uncovered in the industrial district of Alexandria. The original, partially corroded yet structurally intact, featured lathe-shaped rings and a cast-mold core—hallmarks of early precision engineering. Heavy scoring and impact marks suggest it once supported high-speed racing or transport carts, showcasing an early understanding of friction reduction using graphite lubrication. Found amid forge debris, tools, and broken wheel hubs, the artifact symbolizes humankind’s enduring pursuit of mechanical innovation and speed, paralleling Celtic chariot bearings discovered in Gaul.</p>
